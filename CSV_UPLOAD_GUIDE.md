## üîç Troubleshooting CSV Upload

### Issue: "No valid events found"

**Causes:**
1. Missing required columns (Date, Program, or Venue)
2. Invalid date format that couldn't be parsed
3. Empty required fields

**Solutions:**
1. Check your CSV has "Date", "Program", and "Venue" columns
2. Ensure date cells are not empty
3. Try one of the supported date formats listed above

### Issue: "Only some events uploaded"

**Causes:**
- Some rows have empty Date, Program, or Venue fields
- Some dates couldn't be parsed

**Solutions:**
1. Open browser console (F12) to see detailed parsing log
2. Look for "Invalid events details" in console
3. Fix the problematic rows and re-upload

### Issue: Sound Requirements not showing

**Causes:**
- Column might be named "Sound Requirement" (singular)
- System now supports both singular and plural

**Solution:**
- Both "Sound Requirement" and "Sound Requirements" work
- Should be fixed in the latest version

## üß™ Testing Your CSV Before Upload

### Method 1: Browser Console (Recommended)

1. Open the application
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to "Console" tab
4. Upload your CSV
5. Watch the console for detailed information:
   ```
   CSV parsed, total rows: 70
   CSV headers: Date, Program, Crew, Team, Venue, Sound Requirement, Call Time
   Valid events: 68
   Invalid/skipped events: 2
   Invalid events details: [array of problem rows]
   ```

### Method 2: Test Page

1. Open: `/test_csv_parse.html` in your browser
2. Select your CSV file
3. Click "Parse CSV"
4. See detailed breakdown of what will be imported

## üìä What Happens During Upload

1. **File Selection**: You choose your CSV file
2. **Parsing**: PapaParse library reads the CSV
3. **Column Mapping**: System maps your columns to database fields
4. **Date Conversion**: Dates are converted to YYYY-MM-DD format
5. **Validation**: Each row is checked for required fields
6. **Filtering**: Invalid rows are skipped with console warnings
7. **Upload**: Valid events are sent to the database
8. **Confirmation**: Success message shows how many events were uploaded

## üí° Best Practices

### Exporting from Google Sheets

1. **File ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Comma Separated Values (.csv)**
2. Use the first row for column headers
3. Ensure no merged cells
4. Remove any extra empty rows at the bottom

### Preparing Your Data

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use consistent date format throughout
- Fill in at least Date, Program, and Venue for each event
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Remove any extra columns you don't need

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Leave Date, Program, or Venue empty
- Use special characters in date fields
- Merge cells
- Include formulas (export values only)

### Handling Large Uploads

- The system handles up to ~1000 events at once
- For your typical 60-80 events per month, no issues
- If you have many months of data, consider splitting into monthly files

## üîß Advanced: Custom Date Formats

If you have a date format not listed above, you can:

1. Pre-format dates in your spreadsheet to YYYY-MM-DD
2. Or use a formula in Google Sheets:
   ```
   =TEXT(A2,"YYYY-MM-DD")
   ```
   Where A2 is your original date cell
