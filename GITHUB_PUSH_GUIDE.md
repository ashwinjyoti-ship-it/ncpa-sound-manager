# GitHub Push Guide - NCPA Sound Crew

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **All code committed to git**
- 10 commits ready to push
- Working tree clean
- Branch: `main`
- No remote configured yet

## 🔐 Step 1: Set Up GitHub Authorization

### **In GenSpark Interface:**

1. Look for the **"GitHub"** tab or menu option
2. Click **"Connect GitHub"** or **"Authorize GitHub"**
3. Sign in to your GitHub account if prompted
4. Authorize the GenSpark/Code Sandbox app
5. Complete the authorization flow

### **What This Does:**
- Configures git credentials globally
- Sets up GitHub authentication tokens
- Allows pushing/pulling from repositories

---

## 📦 Step 2: Choose Repository Option

You have two options:

### **Option A: Create New Repository**
If you want a fresh repository for this project:

**Repository Name Suggestions:**
- `ncpa-sound-crew`
- `ncpa-event-manager`
- `sound-crew-dashboard`

**Settings:**
- Visibility: Public or Private (your choice)
- Description: "Event management system for NCPA Sound Crew"
- Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### **Option B: Use Existing Repository**
If you already have a repository you want to use:
- Select it from your repository list
- Make sure it's empty or you're ready to force push

---

## 🚀 Step 3: After GitHub is Connected

Once GitHub authorization is complete, I'll help you:

1. **Add remote repository**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify on GitHub**
   - Check that all files are there
   - README.md displays on repository page
   - Code is accessible

## ⚠️ Important: Secrets Not Included

Your `.gitignore` already excludes:
- ✅ `node_modules/` - Dependencies (not pushed)
- ✅ `.env` - Environment variables (not pushed)
- ✅ `.wrangler/` - Local D1 database (not pushed)
- ✅ `.dev.vars` - Local secrets (not pushed)

**Anthropic API Key** is stored in Cloudflare secrets, NOT in code ✅

## 📝 Repository Description Template

When creating the repository, use this description:

```
Event management system for NCPA Sound Crew with AI-powered 
features, calendar views, CSV/Word uploads, and real-time search.
Built with Hono, Cloudflare Workers, D1 database, and Claude AI.
```

**Topics/Tags to add:**
- `cloudflare-pages`
- `cloudflare-workers`
- `hono`
- `event-management`
- `d1-database`
- `claude-ai`

## 🔒 Recommended Repository Settings

### **Visibility:**
- **Public** - If you want to showcase your work
- **Private** - If it's internal NCPA tool only

### **Features to Enable:**
- ✅ Issues (for bug tracking)
- ✅ Projects (for task management)
- ❌ Wiki (not needed, README is comprehensive)
- ❌ Discussions (not needed for small project)

### **Branch Protection (Optional):**
If working with a team:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Prevent force pushes to main

## 🎯 After Successful Push

Once code is on GitHub:

1. **Verify Repository:**
   - README displays properly
   - All files are there
   - No secrets exposed

2. **Add Repository URL:**
   - Update README.md with GitHub link
   - Commit and push again

3. **Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional):**
   - If you want GitHub to host documentation
   - Not needed since app is on Cloudflare Pages

4. **Share Repository:**
   - Share link with team members
   - Add collaborators if needed
