# Safari 18.6 Compatibility Fix

## Problem
The NCPA Sound Crew app was not loading in Safari 18.6, showing only the browser's start page instead of the application.

## Root Cause
Safari has stricter security policies for:
- Service Workers (used by Cloudflare Pages)
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- External CDN resources

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `_headers` File
Created `/home/user/webapp/public/_headers` with proper headers:
```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()
  
/api/*
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type

/static/*
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

### 2. Enhanced CORS Configuration
Updated `src/index.tsx` to use comprehensive CORS settings:
```typescript
app.use('*', cors({
  origin: '*',
  allowMethods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  exposeHeaders: ['Content-Length', 'X-Request-Id'],
  maxAge: 86400,
  credentials: false
}))
```

## Testing in Safari

### 1. Clear Safari Cache
- Safari > Settings > Privacy > Manage Website Data
- Remove all data from `ncpa-sound.pages.dev`
- Click "Done"

### 2. Disable Tracking Prevention (if needed)
- Safari > Settings > Privacy
- Uncheck "Prevent cross-site tracking" (temporarily)

### 3. Open Developer Console
- Right-click page > Inspect Element
- Click "Console" tab
- Look for any remaining errors

### 4. Test the App
Navigate to: **https://e84409d5.ncpa-sound.pages.dev**

## Expected Behavior After Fix
✅ Page loads completely in Safari  
✅ Calendar view displays  
✅ Table view works  
✅ API calls succeed  
✅ All features functional  

## Still Having Issues?

If Safari still doesn't work, try these steps:

1. **Force Refresh**: Hold `Shift + Cmd + R` in Safari
2. **Disable Extensions**: Safari > Settings > Extensions (disable all)
3. **Check Version**: Safari > About Safari (must be 14.0+)
4. **Try Incognito**: File > New Private Window
5. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed requests in Developer Tools

## Deployment Date
- **Fixed**: January 25, 2025
- **Deployment**: https://e84409d5.ncpa-sound.pages.dev
- **Production**: https://ncpa-sound.pages.dev

## Technical Details

### Why Safari Required Special Treatment
Safari enforces stricter security policies than Chrome/Firefox:
- Service Workers must have proper headers
- CORS preflight requests are mandatory
- Content Security Policy is strictly enforced
- Third-party cookies and tracking are blocked by default

### Files Changed
1. `/public/_headers` - Added HTTP security headers
2. `/src/index.tsx` - Enhanced CORS configuration

### Cloudflare Pages Specifics
- `_headers` file is automatically applied by Cloudflare Pages
- Uploaded as part of `npx wrangler pages deploy dist`
- Takes effect immediately after deployment
